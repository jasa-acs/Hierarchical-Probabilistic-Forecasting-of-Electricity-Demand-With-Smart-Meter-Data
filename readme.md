## Data

### Abstract

The data set provides half-hourly smart electricity and gas consumption data between Jan 2008 and Sept 2010 for 14,621 households. Geographic data (Government Office Region and Local Authority) and ACORN segmentation data (http://acorn.caci.co.uk/what-is-acorn) are also available, and can be linked to the consumption data via an anonymised household ID. In our article, we only used electricity consumption and geographic data.
